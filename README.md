SpaceGame
=========

A space themed game written in Java, mostly as a learning exercise.

== Instructions ==

To build:

* `ant`
  
To run:

* `ant run`

== General Brainstorming ==

* zoom in and out on the entire map
* follow projectile on fire
* firing doesn't matter if you are zoomed in our out
* its in space
* projectiles don't instant kill on hit; just take away some health
* one weapon for starters (will add more types later)
* for starters, 2 players at same keybd (later on do multiplayer and single player w/ AI)
* static map for starters, random gen later
* 2d graphics
* basic sounds
* a HUD of some sort showing both players health, angle of fire, thrust of projectile
* players are on planets;  other planets exist and are obstacles/gravity-objects
* blackholes with high gravity could consome projectiles
